# AIdrian
Repository for all my generative AI experiments.

I decided to create this repository to gather all my experiments with generative AI. Here I will mostly publish, from time to time, some finished AI-generated content (i.e., images, text) with code and/or workflows for ComfyUI.

Have a nice day!
## Prompt Bits
### Perplexity
#### Music for month
Create a list of interesting music albums for  {provide_current_month) one for each day. My music taste includes psychedelic rock, thrash metal, death metal, and black metal. Include a mix of genre-defining classics, influential albums from the last five years (2020â€“2024), and fresh releases from 2025. Highlight both well-known bands and hidden gems, including local acts like those from Poland (e.g., Furia). Make the list diverse and fun to explore!
